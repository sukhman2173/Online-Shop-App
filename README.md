# Online-Shop-App
This was one of my first java applications which is the reason why it has a CLI. This application allows user to select from a range of products to add to their shopping cart.
User's can view their shopping cart and checkout the items. This app writes all the order history of users into a text file. This file is read to put through a simple product
suggestion algorithm. This is used to suggest a few products to the user after they have checked out. <br/>
**How to run**<br/>
This application was run on:<br/>
Eclipse Java IDE<br/>
Java SE Development Kit 8 (or newer)
